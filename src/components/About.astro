    <p>
      I’m <b>Syed Zayan Ali</b>, a <b>Python Developer</b> and freelance <b>data automation</b> specialist focused on
      <b>web scraping</b>, <b>data extraction</b>, <b>data cleaning</b>, and building production-ready <b>dashboards</b>.
      I help businesses turn raw data into structured Excel/CSV outputs and decision-ready reports.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work includes <b>Python web scraping with Playwright</b>, <b>data pipelines with Pandas</b>, and
      full-stack dashboard systems using <b>Python Flask</b> with <b>SQL Server</b> (authentication, roles,
      ledger, sales, purchases, expenses, and reporting workflows).
    </p>

    <p>
      I also handle <b>machine learning</b> and <b>text analytics</b> projects, including <b>TF-IDF</b> feature engineering,
      model training (e.g., <b>SVM</b>, <b>Random Forest</b>, <b>XGBoost</b>), and research-style documentation when required.
      If your process is manual, slow, or messy - I’ll automate it into a simple, repeatable system.
